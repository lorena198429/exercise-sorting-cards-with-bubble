# Sorting Cards with Bubble algorithm

Sorting is considered to be an important concept in many programming languages as it helps us locate elements in a faster and easier manner.

The bubble sorting algorithm is one of the easiest to learn and that is the first one normally taught. Here is a 5min explanation on how the bubble algorithm works:

## üìù Instructions

1. Create a function that generates a list of random cards with suits.
1. Let the user specify how much random cards the website should generate using a text input.
2. Add a "draw" button that when clicked it renders those cards on the website in a beautiful way.
3. Add one "sort" button that sorts the cards using the `bubble` sorting algorithm.
4. Save all the changes that you hard to do while sorting the list of cards in a new array.
5. Display the entire log of changes one on top of each other.

## üí° Hint:

1. Strategize first, no one starts coding the solution before having a clear strategy.
2. Stick to your strategy, forget about Stack Overflow for strategy.
3. Divide and conquer, try separating the exercise in smaller exercises, for example:
    - Make the hardcoded CSS and HTML before trying to make it dynamic, that will give you a clear sense of what HTML code you need to build with your algorithm.
    - Generate an array of random cards first, make sure is properly being generated (using the console.log) before trying to render it into the website.
    - Make a function just for building the HTML of ONE card and then re-use it to render all.
